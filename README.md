# RÃ¼gen rising Submod for ET
What is this?
It's a Joke first of all, but then it's also my first steps into Paradox Modding since I made a German Canada in HoI4.
I will focus on one nation at one start date in the Extendet timeline mod. I will probably not finish this since I'm currently writng this after I created this mod 6 hours ago after an exam and it's now 4:22 am

Though there is a slim chance that this will go somewhere

This mod is NOT compatible with any UI mods since they cause crashes with the Ages Screen.
If you do want to play with UI mods you can remove the dependency part of the descriptor.mod file, this should work with versions 0.2.0 and below.

if you want to use aspects of this mod you are free to do so.

### To install:
1. Install Extendet Timeline mod
2. Extract archive into folder within Mod folder
3. Add Extended Timeline and this mod to playset and make sure both are enabled
4. choose playset and press play
5. enjoy :)
